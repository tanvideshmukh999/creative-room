  <h1>Unleash your<br>inner artist</h1>
  <p>With the right pencil, the correct depth of grey and some imagination, you can bring your ideas to life. Here are a few tips and techniques to draw still life.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you are a beginner, pick up simpler shapes and objects.</li>
    <li>Measure your subject. It doesn't have to be precise. It's just to give you an idea of ratio and proportion when you draw it on paper.</li>
    <li>Check the angle you want to draw at. Is it the full front view, or a profile that you are looking to draw.</li>
    <li>Draw a rough shape of the subject to get a feel of the eventual drawing.</li>
    <li>Give a form to the subject by observing the light and shadow areas. Fill the shadow areas with any style of shading you prefer.</li>
    <li>Now remove any unwanted construction lines.</li>
    <li>Correct and smoothen out any sharp edges or where mixing may not be proper.</li>
    <li>Add details and finish.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>Reynolds pencils' triangular construct affords a good grip for better control over paper and the super dark leads give more depth to your drawings.</p>
